## 1. Lecture Content – Backward Looking
Reflection Question #1: How much did you know about the subject before we started?

Prior to the first two INFOSYS221 lectures, I have some foundational knowledge from high-school-level Information & Technology class of what an algorithm is and how it fits into a problem-solving strategy. Additionally, I can relate to some of the algorithm design strategies from Additional Mathematics course I took in high school. These knowledges combined makes it easier for me to digest the content of the course’s lecture.
