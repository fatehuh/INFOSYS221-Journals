# LEARNING JOURNAL 1
## 1. Lecture Content – Backward Looking
*Reflection Question #1: How much did you know about the subject before we started?*

Prior to the first two INFOSYS221 lectures, I have some foundational knowledge from high-school-level Information & Technology class of what an algorithm is and how it fits into a problem-solving strategy. Additionally, I can relate to some of the algorithm design strategies from Additional Mathematics course I took in high school. These knowledges combined makes it easier for me to digest the content of the course’s lecture.

## 2. Lab Content – Inward Looking
*Reflection Question #15: What does this piece reveal about you as a learner?*

I have absolutely no knowledge of Github and its’ knacks for the first lab. Following the instructions given in the lab helps. However, I found out that many of the issues that I will encounter will not be answered in the lab session. Therefore, in addition to the lab content, I prefer to learn from Google searches and Youtube videos in my own time at my own pace to complete the lab assignment, giving me deeper comprehension of the tasks without the rush to catch up to the instructor’s pace.

## 3. Course Overall – Outward Looking
*Reflection Question #21: Did you do your work the way other people did theirs?*

At first, I thought that I took some different path than others to complete the tasks. However, upon seeing people posting their lab task advices on Piazza, it seems that many others are taking the same route that I took and that is amazing! Google searches do wonders for many of our curious people wanting to know how to troubleshoot git pushing on Mac. I tried a few different approaches to the issue but in the end, the solutions that work, is the same solution for many of us. It could be faster for me if I would have just asked my peers, but I enjoyed finding out the solution on my own, too.



# LEARNING JOURNAL 2

## 1. Lecture Content – Backward Looking
*Reflection Question #5: In what ways do you think you need to improve?*

Coding requires you to be precise and there’s not a big margin for error. I do think I need to improve on my memorization of keywords and how a code should be structured about. For example, pseudocode have its own keyword to indicate certain structure, HTML and Java have certain opening and closing tags that I need to include to make sure it works. As an example, I notice that I still get confused on how to end my pseudocode tags sometimes and I could put more practice into that.

# 2. Lab Content – Inward Looking
*Reflection Question #11: What did you find frustrating about it (the piece of work)?*

The process of creating iterations for pseudocode is particularly challenging for me because I haven’t been able to sit down and practice on the topic due to inevitable travelling and I had to miss the lab on pseudocode. However, I still submitted my work for the lab and the marks I got was disappointing. It is rushed work and it frustrates me that I may not have quite grasped pseudo coding skill needed to understand the lab activity.
