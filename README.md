# LEARNING JOURNAL 1
## 1. Lecture Content – Backward Looking
Reflection Question #1: How much did you know about the subject before we started?

Prior to the first two INFOSYS221 lectures, I have some foundational knowledge from high-school-level Information & Technology class of what an algorithm is and how it fits into a problem-solving strategy. Additionally, I can relate to some of the algorithm design strategies from Additional Mathematics course I took in high school. These knowledges combined makes it easier for me to digest the content of the course’s lecture.

## 2. Lab Content – Inward Looking
Reflection Question #15: What does this piece reveal about you as a learner?

I have absolutely no knowledge of Github and its’ knacks for the first lab. Following the instructions given in the lab helps. However, I found out that many of the issues that I will encounter will not be answered in the lab session. Therefore, in addition to the lab content, I prefer to learn from Google searches and Youtube videos in my own time at my own pace to complete the lab assignment, giving me deeper comprehension of the tasks without the rush to catch up to the instructor’s pace.
