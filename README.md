# LEARNING JOURNAL 1
## 1. Lecture Content – Backward Looking
*Reflection Question #1: How much did you know about the subject before we started?*

Prior to the first two INFOSYS221 lectures, I have some foundational knowledge from high-school-level Information & Technology class of what an algorithm is and how it fits into a problem-solving strategy. Additionally, I can relate to some of the algorithm design strategies from Additional Mathematics course I took in high school. These knowledges combined makes it easier for me to digest the content of the course’s lecture.

## 2. Lab Content – Inward Looking
*Reflection Question #15: What does this piece reveal about you as a learner?*

I have absolutely no knowledge of Github and its’ knacks for the first lab. Following the instructions given in the lab helps. However, I found out that many of the issues that I will encounter will not be answered in the lab session. Therefore, in addition to the lab content, I prefer to learn from Google searches and Youtube videos in my own time at my own pace to complete the lab assignment, giving me deeper comprehension of the tasks without the rush to catch up to the instructor’s pace.

## 3. Course Overall – Outward Looking
*Reflection Question #21: Did you do your work the way other people did theirs?*

At first, I thought that I took some different path than others to complete the tasks. However, upon seeing people posting their lab task advices on Piazza, it seems that many others are taking the same route that I took and that is amazing! Google searches do wonders for many of our curious people wanting to know how to troubleshoot git pushing on Mac. I tried a few different approaches to the issue but in the end, the solutions that work, is the same solution for many of us. It could be faster for me if I would have just asked my peers, but I enjoyed finding out the solution on my own, too.



# LEARNING JOURNAL 2

## 1. Lecture Content – Backward Looking
*Reflection Question #5: In what ways do you think you need to improve?*

Coding requires you to be precise and there’s not a big margin for error. I do think I need to improve on my memorization of keywords and how a code should be structured about. For example, pseudocode have its own keyword to indicate certain structure, HTML and Java have certain opening and closing tags that I need to include to make sure it works. As an example, I notice that I still get confused on how to end my pseudocode tags sometimes and I could put more practice into that.

## 2. Lab Content – Inward Looking
*Reflection Question #11: What did you find frustrating about it (the piece of work)?*

The process of creating iterations for pseudocode is particularly challenging for me because I haven’t been able to sit down and practice on the topic due to inevitable travelling and I had to miss the lab on pseudocode. However, I still submitted my work for the lab and the marks I got was disappointing. It is rushed work and it frustrates me that I may not have quite grasped pseudo coding skill needed to understand the lab activity.

## 3. Assignment Content – Outward Looking
*Reflection Question #30: If someone else were looking at the piece, what might they learn about who you are?*

If someone were to take a good look at my assignment 1 work, they may find out that I have rushed it somehow. They may assume that I’m someone who does their tasks in the last minute. I would agree with them on the former, it’s true my assignment was rushed work and it may seem a little shabby but I am not usually someone who starts tasks late. On the other hand, if they had knowledge of my situation prior to looking at my work, they may think it’s not bad work after all. They may think there’s room for improvement.

## 4. Course Overall – Forward Looking
*Reflection Question #32: What would you change if you had a chance to do this piece over again?*

I truly want to revise my lab submission and get feedbacks from the teaching staffs again to improve my pseudo coding skills. Time is a constraint here and I am trying to catch up with other aspect of the course. I understood that my lab work was not completed, and I might have new ideas for new iterations that can be made just that it may not be a priority at the moment. I also may have asked my assignment group members to help me on the submission. If I could change my lab work, I would want to ask for help from my group member on the work.


# LEARNING JOURNAL 3

## 1. Lecture Content – Forward Looking
*Reflection Question #36: What’s one goal you would like to set for yourself for the next time?*

Starting after mid-semester break, I would like to read the module notes before coming into the lecture because I did just that for another course, where I read slides before coming to lecture, and it made the material contents easier to understand and digest. I am struggling a bit with INFOSYS221 and I want to overcome it, therefore, my goal is to alleviate my issue by coming in prepared.

## 2. Lab Content – Outward Looking
*Reflection Question #29: In what ways did your work not meet the standards for this assignment?*

During the group exercise for Lab 5, I tried to contribute to the discussion of writing the codes. I have the idea of how to structure the code and where to reuse functions, but I can improve better as a code writer. My part of the group work does not meet the lab assignment standard because there are some incomplete functions calls that we forgot to include and I overlooked it.

## 3. Assignment Content – Inward Looking
*Reflection Question #13: Did you meet your standards?*

My groups matched my standards in designing the prototype for our application. I find our group prototype to be neat and professional-looking and it ticks all of the boxes for me. We did go beyond what the instructor asked of us and used digital prototyping instead of paper prototype and it turns out great. I am pleased with my group’s assignment 2 effort.

## 4. Course Overall – Backward Looking
*Reflection Question #4: In what ways have you gotten better at this kind of work?*

I am getting better at comprehending Javascript, there is definitely improvement in my understanding after having spent time writing Javascript codes with my group members who are better at it than I am. When we do the lab together, I watch intently on how their thought process work when they write the code and I learn from them.

## 5. Git Content
*Which git command did I use and why*

Disclaimer: I chose git revert and tried to execute the command, however, I encountered “unmerged paths” error that I cannot fix and therefore, unable for it to show for my git revert commit. To still demonstrate that I know how to git revert, I will list the command I ran:

1.	I committed all four reflection questions on my local repository and git pushed it to my remote repository.
2.	I check my git status and git log.
3.  I run a git reflog command. Check for SHA number of reflection question 3.
4.	I then run the command git revert (commit SHA number), in my case, git revert ac62f63.
5.	I then encounter “unmerged path” issue but I’m sure if the error did not interfere, I should then run another git push to update my remote repository.

For me, I chose git revert to undo the third reflection question because git revert will maintain all my other question commits and uses new commit to undo just the one specific commit that I made for question 3.


# LEARNING JOURNAL 4

## 1. Lecture Content
I started preparing for lecture session by having my notes printed prior to watching lecture recordings and skimmed through. It has helped me have basic idea of the topics rather than just leaving me blank as the lecturers explain the topic. It may be hard to keep doing this due to my packed schedule but doing it whenever I can make the differences. Small progress is progress!

## 2. Lab Content
There is a lot of confusion going on for me when it comes to object template and JSON. Therefore, I contributed lesser than all my group members in this week’s lab. Nonetheless, I learned a lot from the lab as my group members discussed object templates, constructors, JSON (and I googled a lot of what they were talking about). My new focus is to understand object better.

## 3. Mid-Term Test Content
I struggled with the mid-term test content because of time constraint, especially with the coding part of the test. I understood most coding questions and how it needs to be answered but I took a really long time to structure my answer. Along with other questions taking my time to understand and answer, I had to leave a few coding questions blank. More frequent hands-on practices should really improve my timing issue.

## 4. Course Overall
I find myself quite struggling with the course’s recording issues even though the lecturer will recap it in the next one. I feel like it is not the same thing repeated, as it is just a recap and I have missed out on something crucial adding to my confusion on some topic. I do think I am slowly lagging behind for this course, but I should be able to keep up in the next week or two.


# LEARNING JOURNAL 5

## 1. Lecture Content
For this week, I am lagging behind on lecture content due to some unavoidable personal circumstances. I only have the faintest idea of what this week’s lecture is about, however, I will be making time during this weekend in order to catch up with this week’s recorded lecture. I may ask one of my project group members to brief me on the topic and perhaps explain any difficult parts to me so that I will have some peer guidance on the topic.
